I used Python and OpenCV to do this perception challenge. I used opencv and numpy for my libraries. I had to read up on how lane detection is done, and realized that I had to grayscale, blur, and do some other changes to get rid of noise and then detect the cones. Once I got the mask, I separated the cones only using color ranges, then using k-means clustering (as Han recommended me to) to get the contours properly. I had to change the kernel size for it to fit the situaton properly. Then, getting the centers of these shapes, I split them into 2 columns, a left and right. Originally I was having an issue, where all the lines were criss-crossing each other and touching every contour, but I fixed this and took a different apporach by using fitLine() on each side to basically get the best fit line using all these points. I was able to get the appropriate points for fitLine() from the left and right column arrays. Finally, I saved them into answer.png.
